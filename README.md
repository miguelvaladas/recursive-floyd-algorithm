# FLOYD WARSHALL ALGORITHM: A RECURSIVE APPROACH

## Overview

Floyd Warshall algorithm implementation using recursion presented as an assignment for the CSCK541 Software Development in Practice module of the MSc. in Computer Science at the University of Liverpool.   

## Implementations

- **Iterative and Recursive Implementations**: The class FloydWarshallAlgorithm class contains an implementation that allows users to opt for an iterative or recursive approach.

## Testing
Both approaches were unit tested against a multitude of graphs and performance tests comparing both approaches are written to the ```performance_test_results.txt``` file as they are executed.

## Installation

Clone the repository
```git clone https://github.com/miguelvaladas/recursive-floyd-algorithm.git```

Navigate to the project directory
```cd floyd-warshall-algorithm```
